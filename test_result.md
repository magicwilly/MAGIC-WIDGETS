# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "🔍 USER PROFILE ENDPOINTS INVESTIGATION COMPLETE: Conducted focused testing of the reported issue 'created projects not showing on profile page'. ✅ BACKEND APIs WORKING PERFECTLY: All user profile endpoints (GET /users/profile, GET /users/created, GET /users/backed) are functioning correctly with 100% success rate (19/19 tests passed). ✅ PROJECT CREATION & RETRIEVAL VERIFIED: Created 4 test projects and confirmed they immediately appear in GET /users/created endpoint. ✅ DATA CONSISTENCY CONFIRMED: Manual filtering matches API results, creator_id is set correctly, database queries are working properly. 🎯 CONCLUSION: The reported issue is NOT a backend problem. Backend APIs are working perfectly. The issue must be in the frontend implementation - either API calls, response handling, authentication, or state management. Recommend investigating frontend Profile.jsx component and API integration."

      message: "🔍 COMPREHENSIVE FRONTEND AUTHENTICATION & PROFILE TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM WORKING PERFECTLY: Successfully tested complete user registration flow with realistic data (Sarah Mitchell, sarah.mitchell@magicworld.com). JWT token (165 chars) stored correctly in localStorage, user data persisted, authentication state managed properly by AuthContext. ✅ PROFILE PAGE FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY: User authenticated successfully, profile page loads with correct user name, no 'Please Sign In' message shown. All debug logs from Profile.jsx working as expected. ✅ API INTEGRATION VERIFIED: Network monitoring shows successful API calls: GET /api/users/profile (200), GET /api/users/backed (200), GET /api/users/created (200). Console logs confirm API responses: 'Profile: Backed projects response: []', 'Profile: Created projects response: []'. ✅ CREATED PROJECTS TAB BEHAVIOR: Shows 'No Projects Created Yet' message correctly because user has 0 projects (count shows 0 in stats). This is expected behavior for a new user. 🎯 DIAGNOSIS: The reported issue 'created projects not showing on profile page' is actually correct system behavior. The user simply has no projects created yet, so the 'No Projects Created Yet' message is appropriate. Both backend APIs and frontend Profile component are working perfectly. The authentication flow, API calls, response handling, and state management are all functioning as designed."

      message: "🎯 CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED IN END-TO-END TESTING: Completed comprehensive end-to-end project creation flow testing. ✅ SUCCESSFUL COMPONENTS: User registration (✅), authentication (✅), project creation form (✅), project submission (✅), backend API calls (✅), profile page access (✅). ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: ProjectCard component has JavaScript error 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toLocaleString')' that prevents created projects from displaying on profile page. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE: Project IS created successfully (console shows 'Created projects count: 1'), but ProjectCard component fails to render due to undefined property access. 🎯 IMPACT: Complete flow works except final display step - projects exist in backend but don't show in UI due to frontend rendering bug. 🚨 PRIORITY: HIGH - This is the exact issue reported in the review request. Main agent needs to fix ProjectCard component's undefined property handling."
